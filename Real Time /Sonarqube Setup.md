## Sonarqube Setup for Realtime 

Set up SonarQube for Azure DevOps in a real-time organizational environment and authenticate it with your project using Azure DevOps Classic Editor, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up SonarQube Server**
You need to have a SonarQube server running, either:
- **On-premise**: Install and configure the SonarQube server on your infrastructure.
- **Cloud-hosted**: Use a cloud-hosted version of SonarQube.

### 2. **Install SonarQube Extension for Azure DevOps**
1. Go to the **Azure DevOps Marketplace**.
2. Search for **SonarQube**.
3. Click on **SonarQube** and install the extension into your Azure DevOps organization.

### 3. **Create a SonarQube Project**
1. On your SonarQube server, log in as an administrator.
2. Create a new project by going to **Projects** > **Create Project**.
3. Note the **project key** and **project name**, as you'll need them later to connect with Azure DevOps.

### 4. **Generate a SonarQube Token for Authentication**
1. In SonarQube, navigate to your user profile (top-right corner) and go to **My Account** > **Security**.
2. Generate a new **Token**. Copy the token value as it will only be shown once.

### 5. **Configure Service Connection in Azure DevOps**
1. In **Azure DevOps**, go to **Project Settings** > **Service connections**.
2. Click on **New service connection** and choose **SonarQube**.
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Server URL**: URL of your SonarQube server.
   - **Authentication Token**: Use the token you generated in the previous step.
   - **Service Connection Name**: Choose an appropriate name.
4. Save the connection.

### 6. **Modify the Pipeline Using the Classic Editor**

In the **Classic Editor** of Azure DevOps, follow these steps to integrate SonarQube into your build pipeline:

1. **Open the Classic Editor**:  
   Go to **Pipelines** > **Builds** > Choose your pipeline > Click **Edit**.

2. **Add SonarQube Tasks to Your Pipeline**:
   In the classic editor, you need to add 3 SonarQube-related tasks in the following order:
   
   #### a) **Prepare Analysis Configuration**:
   - Click on **Add Task** and search for **SonarQube**.
   - Select **Prepare Analysis Configuration**.
   - Under the **SonarQube Service Endpoint**, select the **SonarQube Service Connection** you created earlier.
   - Enter the **Project Key** and **Project Name** (from the SonarQube project you created earlier).

   #### b) **Run Code Analysis**:
   - Add another task and select **Run Code Analysis** (SonarQube).
   - This task will run the actual analysis on your code during the build.

   #### c) **Publish Quality Gate Result**:
   - Add the final task called **Publish Quality Gate Result**.
   - This task will verify if the project meets the quality gate criteria defined in SonarQube.

3. **Build and Test Task**:
   Ensure your build tasks like **MSBuild** or **Maven** tasks are correctly configured before the **Run Code Analysis** task, as SonarQube will analyze the compiled code.

### 7. **Set up Authentication for the Azure DevOps Project**

SonarQube uses the token generated earlier to authenticate with Azure DevOps. This token is linked to the **Service Connection** you created. It will automatically authenticate whenever the **Prepare Analysis Configuration** step is executed in the pipeline.

### 8. **Trigger the Pipeline and Review Results**
- Run the build pipeline after saving the changes.
- Once the build is complete, SonarQube will publish the analysis results back to the SonarQube server.
- You can view the **code analysis results** and the **quality gate status** directly from the SonarQube dashboard or through the build summary in Azure DevOps.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Quality Gates**: You can configure **quality gates** in SonarQube to ensure that the code meets your organizationâ€™s quality standards.
- **Branch Analysis**: If you're using branches in your project, ensure SonarQube is set up to analyze different branches.

By following these steps, you can set up SonarQube integration with Azure DevOps in an organization and authenticate your project using the Classic Editor pipeline.
