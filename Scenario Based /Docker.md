# Scenario:

#### 1) Imagine you are tasked with containerizing a Java based application for deployment.you start by creating a docker image using the openjdk:11 base image;as it includes the java run time environment and seems like a logical choice.However you soon realize that this image also includes unnecessary packages and tools,bloating the image size and potentially increasing the attack surface.How can you avoid including unnecessary components in your Docker imagewhile ensuring that it remains secure and efficient?
