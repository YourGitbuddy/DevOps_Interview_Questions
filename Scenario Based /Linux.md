# Linux based Scenarios Questions

#### 1) Can you describe a scenario where you need to troubleshoot a performance issue on a Linux server?

**Ans**: Sure. Let's say there is a web application running on a Linux server, and users are reporting slow response times. The first step would be to check the system resource utilization using commands like `top`, `htop`, or `ps`. This would give an overview of CPU, memory, and disk usage.

### 2) let's say the CPU usage is high. How would you identify the processes consuming the most CPU?

**ANS**: I would use the 'top' command and sort processes by CPU usage. Alternatively, I could use `ps` with options like `aux --sort=-%cpu' to list processes by CPU consumption. Once identified, I would investigate those processes further to understand why they are consuming so much CPU. Convert this into github redme. File
